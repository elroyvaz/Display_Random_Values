# Display_Random_Values

### Introduction

Welcome to the Data Analyst repository! This repository contains an Excel project designed to facilitate the generation and analysis of triangularly distributed random numbers. The project includes a spreadsheet application that allows users to input random values, sort them according to minimum, most likely, and maximum values, and visualize the data using bar graphs.

### Sections

1. **Introduction Sheet**
   - This sheet serves as the entry point to the Excel project.
   - Features a button named "Display random values" to initiate the random value generation process.
   - Upon clicking the button, a control panel opens for users to input values.

2. **Random Number Generation**
   - Users can input random values into the control panel.
   - The application generates triangularly distributed random numbers based on the input values.
   - Random numbers are sorted into columns representing minimum, most likely, and maximum values.

3. **Data Visualization (Bar Graph)**
   - Data generated in the "Introduction" sheet is visualized using a bar graph.
   - The "bar-graph" sheet displays the distribution of random values.

**Key Takeaways**

- **User-Friendly Interface:** üñ•Ô∏è The Excel project features a user-friendly interface with a control panel for easy input of random values.
